## intro

As specified by the **Fetch Coding Takehome** description, I've created an app to allow users to search and select their favorite dog breeds, fetch their images from an external API, and scroll through a dynamic page! 

## features

For this project, I included:

- **Typing Effect!:** i <3 typing animations
- **Breed Dictionary:** users can search for specific dog breeds and select them using checkboxes!
- **Image Fetching:** once a breed is selected, the app fetches up to six images of the selected breed and displays them on the page

## tech stack

- **Frontend:** [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework) and some vanilla CSS whereever I saw fit!
- **External API:** [Dog CEO's Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript for Logic**
